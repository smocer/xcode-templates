# How to use
1. Download the template file
2. Move it to `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/Project Templates/` folder:
```bash
mv UIKit\ App\ (no\ storyboard).xctemplate ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/Project\ Templates/UIKit\ App\ (no\ storyboard).xctemplate
```
3. Now it should be available in the Xcode menu: File -> New -> Project under the "Project Templates" category.

# Limitations
- Objective-C is not supported (although it can be chosen because this template inherits from the default single view app template).
